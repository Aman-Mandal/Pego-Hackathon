## Automated Functionality

PegoCall provides two methods for automating smart contract calls:

- Time-based Method: Using this method, you can automate smart contract function calls by providing the contract address, ABI, and the specific function you want to automate. Additional information such as task name can also be provided. PegoCall will execute the function based on a predefined time schedule.
- Custom Logic Method: In this method, you enter the contract address and ABI, and the automated function will be written inside the smart contract itself. PegoCall acts as a user interface to interact with the smart contract and trigger the automated function.
